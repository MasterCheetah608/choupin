(The name Choupin comes from our wonderful teacher Dr. Chou and the amazing composer Chopin)
# Our Story
We thought of music and mental health, and came up with a music therapy bot: Choupin! Our inspiration comes from piano apps.

Most piano apps have non-customizable note lengths, weird key bindings, or are locked behind a paywall, so we decided to create our own application.
# Inspiration
We got our inspiration from piano apps that allow you to press notes. We donâ€™t know of any Discord bot that had this feature, so we decided to make a Discord bot.
# Project Process
We used Discord API to host our Discord bot and use slash commands with buttons for note input.

# Our plans for the future
In the future, we plan to continue spreading a message of positivity and kindness, all the while enjoying our hobbies and hopefully interesting more people in computer science.
