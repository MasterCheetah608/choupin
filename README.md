(The name Choupin comes from our wonderful teacher Dr. Chou and the amazing composer Chopin)
# Our Story
We thought of music and mental health, and came up with a music therapy bot: Choupin! Our inspiration comes from piano apps.

Most piano apps have non-customizable note lengths, weird key bindings, or are locked behind a paywall, so we decided to create our application.

During quarantine, music took up an immense part of our lives. We used it as a form of therapy during COVID, and to fill up the empty part of our lives. We want to use this application to show the world the specialties and effectiveness of music therapy.

We want to use music therapy to offer great help to those with cognitive difficulties. Participating in musical activities may help reduce impairments, improve cognitive function, and improve overall mood. It is an effective tool for everyone.
# Inspiration
We got our inspiration from piano apps that allow you to press notes. We didn’t know of any Discord bot with this feature, so we decided to make a Discord bot.
# Project Process
- Made Discord Bot
  - Used Discord API and JDA API, Hosted with IntelliJ, and used Maven as the build automation tool
- Coded User Input
   - Used slash commands that allow the user to press buttons for note input and utilize dropdowns for octaves
- Added song play
  - Recorded classical songs and jazz improvisation for music therapy
# Project features
- Note Input
  - The user can input a string of notes, of any octave, and of any pitch! Their musical creation will be played back to them in the voice channel.
- Song Play
  - There are a variety of song selections the user can play for music therapy — we have jazz, soothing music, classical, and more!
- Music Tutorial
  - Allows the user to learn how to play the piano and music! Offers a basic guide.
# Challenges we faced
- Adding so many features was a difficult task
- Faced lots of bugs
  - We worked through it!
- Audio issues
  - The default audio play had bad quality — so we had to record our own and figure that out!
# Our plans for the future
We plan to create more applications with music, music therapy, and coding in the future! We want to make a tuner application in the future.
